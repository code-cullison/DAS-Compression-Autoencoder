# Convolutional Autoencoder for Compressing Distributed Acoustic Sensing Data from Urban Environments

The Autoencoder model is based on Lossy Data Compression from Tensorflow's official tutorial: https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/data_compression

## Project Description
Training an autoencoder to compress vast Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) data. The goal is to achieve data compression with minimal loss.

## Setup and Dependencies
Code has been tested in Google Colab on T4, L4, V100, and A100 instances. 

### Required dependencies:

1. Python (version 3.10.11)
2. TensorFlow (version 2.12.0)
3. NumPy (version 1.22.4)
4. Matplotlib (version 3.7.1)

## Dataset
The data used in this project can potentially be obtained by contacting tculliso-\[AT\]-stanford-dot-edu
